    <li>In loose defense, if Op1 does not have a lane between him and the ball, special op should just play shot-block on op2.

    <td><ul>
    <li>Fixed cage defense play to refer to goalie box, not the defense zone, when determining what blocker does when grabbing and
        retreating with the ball.
    <li>special op default position changed in loose defense for a few reasons. First, by placing him on the other side of the field we spread
our robots out a little. Second, it is impossible to score on us by bouncing the ball off the special op in his new location. Old location was BAD.
    <li>Explicitly stated that special op must remain offset while behind aggressor in upfield defense so as to catch stray knocked balls. Also stated that
BehindScreenOffense should not screen opponents too far away or too close to aggressor.
    <li>In tight defense, special op should behind in same was as in loose defense if no opponents are around. Default position is on opposite 
side of field in sweet sector, defense zone, splitting angle between ball and center of opponent goal.

    <li>Defender always plays off blocker in tight defense, never handles opponents in consideration zone any more.
	<li>Added documentation re position switching in every play.
	<li>In remove ball defense, fixed image and documentation re the special op and the defender. The defender plays on the
	    opposite side of the field as the ball. Makes transitions much smoother this way.

    <td><ul>
    <li>Moved two opponent robots down to be in front of our goal in 
        remove ball defense figure.
    <li>Moved creator down to receive a chip kick and moved the special op 
        down to help defend in case the chip kick is blocked in illustration.
    <li>Moved two opponent robots down to in front of the cage in the cage 
defense illustration.
    <li>Updated remove ball defense play to have a special op defender 
(not special op aggressor), have the creator come down to receive a chip 
kick with the aggressor, and have the special op defender work with the 
defender playing loose defense (staying back by the defense zone). 
    <li>Modified transition from remove ball defense to loose defense to 
also occur when vision data indicates the ball has traveled significantly 
far away from the blocker.
    <li>Added two way transition between loose defense and cage 
defense. Also fixed transitions to tight defense from loose and cage 
defense to be worded properly. 
    <li>In tight defense, noted that blocker should split 4cm of defense 
zone he does not cover in half, 2cm on either side, thus resolving a 
number of issues with cross crease passes, getting stuck, and having a 
shot on goal between him and the post.
    <li>Changed special op defender in loose defense to remove opponents 
who are beyond a grace distance behind the ball, thus allowing opponents 
that are slightly behind the ball but still a great threat to be 
shot-blocked.
    <li>Added notes section to overview page and added note that 
hysteresis will be used for play transitions.
    <li>Fixed Special Op Creator and Creator to always look toward ball in 
double pick offense.
    <li>Modified special op aggressor in single assist to have a more 
defined role. When aggressor behind imaginary line run screens or picks. 
When aggressor moves past this line (x-coord) then fall back and get ready 
to pick up the ball if it gets knocked behind the aggressor.
    <li>In single assist offense, allow the aggressor to pass to the 
creator if a pass is possible.
    <li>In creator assist offense, shifted the man on the aggressor to the 
right and the man on the special op left to emphasize the scenario where 
the creator could shoot on goal where as the remaining players could not 
(previously the aggressor would have shot on goal since he could).
    <li>Rotated aggressor to look directly towards the creator in the 
cross crease pass in the illustration.
    <li>In positions list for loose defense, fixed special op aggressor to 
be special op defender, stupid typo
    <li>Added a new play! Upfield Defense! This helps avoid having the 
special op from running back and forth between the upfield and the 
back field, especially since he's needed to back up the aggressor much more 
when the ball is loose upfield.
    <li>Changed touch shoot and jam and shoot plays to transition to upfield defense, not loose defense.
    <li>Added various notes to the bottom of the overview.
