   <h2><b>Play: <font color="green">Cage Defense</font></b></h2>        
   <h3><b><u>Description:</u></b></h3>
   This play is called when we are in the worst possible scenario: 
   the ball is in both the death zone and the middle sector. This is one of 
   the weakest situations in this years competition, for the most part due to the 
   increased goal width and overall field width. The defender and aggressor 
   form a cage around the blocker, allowing the blocker to obtain possession 
   of the ball. The special op defender blocks interfering opponents while 
   the creator stays farther upfield, hopefully keeping a few opponents with 
   him and out of the action.
