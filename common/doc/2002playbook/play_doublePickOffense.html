        These robots work in random to setup a double pick. First, 
construct an array of opponent locations. Remove opponents that are in the 
defense zone, are on the opposite side of the field than the ball 
(widthwise), or are not behind the ball (see figure). Next order 
the opponents from closest to farthest to the 
opponent goal line by their x-coordinate. Picks are then constructed on 
the inside edge (closer to center of field along width). Creator picks the 
closest to the opponent goal and the special op creator picks the second 
closest. This allows the aggressor to dribble around both picks to an open 
other side of the field (or at least removing two robots from play), while 
leaving the special op closer to the middle of the field allows him to 
quickly become the special op aggressor and not have to cross pass the 
creator at a later time. During picks both positions should always look 
directly at the ball.<br><br>Special Op Creator: <b>DoublePickBlockSkill</b><br>Creator: <b>DoublePickBlockSkill</b>
