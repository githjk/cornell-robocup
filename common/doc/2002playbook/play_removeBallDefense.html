    <h3><b><u>Description:</u></b></h3>
This play is called when the blocker has possession of the ball in the
defense zone. The central goal is for the blocker to then grab and
chip-kick the ball to either the special op aggressor or aggressor which
are placed behind the half line. The creator lies slightly farther upfield
ready for a quick pass or drive upfield. The defender stays back, blocking
opponents from interfering with the blocker.

        Loose Screen closest opponents outside defense zone from blocker, allowing him to 
        remove the ball more freely. Opponent must be in defense 
        zone. If no such opponent exists go to center of this area. 
General idea is to play loose defense, staying back and just in front of 
the defense zone. This makes is harder for the opponent to juke around us 
and score since in doing so they would have to enter the defense zone and 
hopefully contact our blocker. <b>Defender plays on the opposite side of the field as the ball and the special op plays on the same side of the field as the ball.</b>
