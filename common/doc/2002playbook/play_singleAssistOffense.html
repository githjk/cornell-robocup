    <h2><b>Play: <font color="green">Single Assist Offense</font></b></h2>    
    <h3><b><u>Description:</u></b></h3>
Single assist is the primary offensive play of the system and is the first
to be called once any of our robots (excluding the blocker) gets possession
of the ball. The primary objective is moving the ball up the field with
the aggressor using dribbling and juking techniques. This play will always
branch to one of the various other offensive plays once a timer has run
out.

incorporate numbers of robots on either side of field upfield and make 
more proper decision.

or juke skills.
        <li>As described by transitions, may decide to work closer with 
creator and special op creator/aggressor either with picks, passes, or 
transition to jam and shoot to directly score.

       Move up along with the aggressor. Either run strong arm offense 
skill or screen on attacking opponents. Always looking back at Aggressor 
for a quick dish-pass. When opponents get near, set up picks. Once 
aggressor moves past an imaginary line (x-cord) special op should fall back 
and travel just behind the aggressor. This opens up space for shots and 
dribbling for the aggressor since room will be limited, as well as sets 
the special op to become the aggressor if the ball gets knocked just 
behind the aggressor.

Offense if there exist 2 opponents between the ball and the opponent goal, neither of which 
is in the opponent defense zone (thus excluding the opponent blocker), and are between the 
split line and the side line closer to the ball. This constraint ensures that if the play 
does transition that there will exist to opponents that the special op creator and creator 
can pick and leave open the other half of the field for the aggressor to take the ball up 
through.

The basic idea is that the aggressor passes to another robot, who immediately kicks it right 
back to him. Meanwhile the opponents run over in the wrong direction and we use their 
filtering/poor prediction against them, rushing around upfield in the opposite direction.
