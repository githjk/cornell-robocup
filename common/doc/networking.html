    <h3><b><u>Architecture:</u></b></h3>
This year’s system is a TCP/IP-based server-client architecture based on Winsock (the standard Window’s network library).  In our setup, nodes have three possible designations: JUST_SEND, JUST_RECEIVE, and SEND_RECEIVE.  JUST_SEND is used for server nodes, JUST_RECEIVE, for clients, and SEND_RECIEVE designates a node which can act as both.  

    <a name="Server_Side"></a>
    <h3><b><u>Server Side:</u></b></h3>
To instantiate a server, one must specify the type, the address, and port number the server is to be established with.  Once instantiated, the server sets up a listening socket on the specified port and creates a data structure for managing connections.  The server then starts a listener running on a separate thread so it is free to perform other tasks while also monitoring any connection requests.
When a client requests a connection from the server, a handshake is initiated (standard TCP/IP) to confirm the connection.

    <a name="Client_Side"></a>
    <h3><b><u>Client Side:</u></b></h3>
In order to establish a connection with the server, the client is first instantiated using the appropriate IP address and port number and the connection() method is called.  The client type and server type must match for a connection to open successfully.  For example if the server type and/or client type is not recognized or not an allowable configuration (senseless to have two JUST_SEND entities connect to each other), the connection will not be created.  If the connection succeeds, the client and server can communicate using the send() and receive() methods.

CommType is a structure that defines the communication mode the client or server can take on.  These modes include: duplex mode defined as SEND_RECEIVE, send-only mode defined as JUST_SEND, and receive-only mode defined as JUST_RECEIVE.  
<p>
Class Socket: Contains methods to set up a socket connection; open/close connection; send and receive data over the connection.  It is uses the Winsock library and provides the basic calls which are used by both client and server classes.
In order to use this class, user should use ws2_32.lib when linking. This can be done by going to Project->Settings in Visual C++. Click on the Link tab and within Object/library modules, add the statement: “ws2_32.lib”

Method Details:
<p>    
<font color="blue">Server (CommType serverType, int MaxSend, int MaxReceive )</font><br>
Constructor of the server class.  It takes in the type of server.  Possible types are defined in CommType.h and are as follows:<br>
JUST_SEND: server that only sends data (e.g. Vision)<br>
JUST_RECEIVE: server that only receives data<br>
SEND_RECEIVE: server that both sends and receives data<br>
<p>    
Servers accept a certain max number of clients that can send and/or receive data<br>
<p>    
    Input parameter:<br>

1) The server and client types are compatible<br>
2) There are still available slots for the incoming client type.<br>
It also checks if there is already a connection set up for the client.  If there is, the server ignores the new connection request and returns false.<br>

    <h3><b><u>Constraints:</u></b></h3>
Networking is one of many pieces whose combined time must be under 16.6ms so that our system is able to run at 60 frames per second.  Because our system is currently running on a 100Mb/s local Ethernet there negligible timing delays once our packets get to the wire.  It is important to have the Nagle algorithm switched off, since the Nagle algorithm clusters packets and prevents them from being sent immediately (it does so as to avoid the “silly window” syndrome which is more of a problem for networks with higher overall utilization).  Due to the real-time qualities of our domain, it is critical that we send packets as soon as possible, thus the Nagle algorithm should stay off.
