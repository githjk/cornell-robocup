    <h3><b><u>Overall Strategy:</u></b></h3>
  The 2002 strategy provides multiple offensive plays so as to allow for 
various approaches against various opposing teams, several defensive plays 
dictated by the position of the ball, and a new robot position, the 
special op, which is dedicated to helping any of the other robots at any 
time. Unlike past approaches in which robots would have to deal with each 
other in a haphazard manner, the special op always acts as a slave, never 
deciding where to go himself, always allowing one of the other robots to 
control him.
<p>
At all times there exist four robot positions on the field: Blocker, 
Defender, Aggressor, and Creator. The fifth robot position, the special 
op, can take on one of three varieties: special op defender, special op 
aggressor, or special op creator. The name is essentially irrelovent since 
the special op always takes on one of these roles, but by using one of 
three names, the other positions on the field can utilize this position if 
it becomes available. A simple example is if a defensive play is being 
called, the defender can "look" to see if a special op defender exists. If 
so the defender can control himself and the special op defender to work in 
tandem, and if not the defender can act alone. By creating this special op 
position our system can quickly and easily scale down to a four robot 
system, if we ever were to receive a red card or were to suffer massive 
electro-mechanical failure. Further removal of positions is also quite 
possible.
<p>
From a plays perspective, there are ten plays which cover offensive and 
defensive situations. These plays take advantage of our improved control, 
passing and quick shooting capabilities, and the chip kick the blocker 
will have this year. Below follows a diagram of the field, which is split 
up into a series of zone and sectors, a list of the robot positions and 
what these positions generally do, and a list of plays and overall outline 
of the play strategy. By clicking on the plays in the playbook you can visit 
each play and position in detail.

    <a name="Positions"></a>
    <h3><b><u>Positions:</u></b></h3>
  <b>Blocker:</b>
  The blocker is essentially the goalie with a new name. We are intentionally 
changing the names of ALL plays and ALL positions this year to make it 
clear exactly what we are talking about when we speak about a certain 
play/positions/skill. The Blocker remains in the defense zone the majority 
of the time, only venturing slightly outside of it at times (offensive 
plays and loose defense). The Blocker is the only position that will try 
to grab the ball, and only when inside of the goalie box.
<p>

  <b>Defender:</b>
The defender is a dedicated position to the defense. The defender always 
remains on our side of the field, almost entirely in the defense zone, and 
works with or supplements the actions of the blocker, stopping shots 
or closing holes whenever possible. The defender does not go after the 
ball, instead he acts to form a wall with the blocker at all times.<p>

  <b>Aggressor:</b>
The aggressor is the most active player on the field. See a robot who has 
the ball, he's undoubtedly the aggressor. See a robot go up to an opponent 
who has the ball, either to screen him from our goal or strip the ball 
away, again, that is the aggressor.

<p>
  <b>Creator:</b>
The creator is our dedicated robot to "creating" opportunities, be they 
passing or dribbling. The creator spends the majority of his time far 
upfield, either in the kill zone, offensive zone, and sometimes as low but 
never lower than the upper middle zone. The creator is the man to pass to 
in a cross-crease pass, and also the man that helps in setting up a double 
pick.

<p>
  <b>Special Op Defender:</b>
The first of the special op positions, the special op defender acts as an 
auxiliary defender. When available, the special op defender may screen 
auxiliary opponents coming down field from getting near the ball. He may 
also help block passes or shots on goal. Usually the special op roams 
slightly in front of the defender, or on the opposite side of the field, 
allowing him to move upfield and become a special op aggressor or special 
op creator when the play changes.

<p>
  <b>Special Op Aggressor:</b>
The special op aggressor assists the aggressor. This means running screens 
to help the aggressor dribble up the field, setting up picks for quicker 
jukes by the aggressor, and also getting open for quick passes upfield 
when the aggressor gets bogged down.

<p>
  <b>Special Op Creator:</b>
The special op creator only comes up in a few scenarios, namely the 
creator assist offensive play. He helps the creator create opportunities 
by screening or various other blocking techniques. He also gets open for a 
pass under such scenarios.
