    <h3><b><u>Connecting to a Vision System:</u></b></h3>

In order to have the AI connect to a vision system you must provide the IP address of the machine 
the vision system is running on when you start the AI. Go to robocup-ai-2002/runtime folder,
open a command prompt and type <font color="blue">robocupAI <ipAddress of the vision machine></font>
<p>
Since the vision system is usually run from Athena, running the AI without this argument will default
to connecting to a vision system on Athena. Since typing in IP's for various computers is annoying, we
have created a number of bat files that automate this process. If you want to connect to a vision system on
the local machine, use localAI.bat. If the 
vision system goes down while the AI is on, the AI need not close and restart to reconnect. Using the menu 
entries or simply typing control-v will connect/disconnect from the vision system at the specified ip.

    <h3><b><u>Connecting to a Simulator:</u></b></h3>

To run the AI with the simulator, first you must start the simulator. Go to 
robocup-ai-2002/runtime folder/2002SimulatorBinaries. Click on <font color="blue">
5x5simulator.bat</font> to start the simulator. To modify the behavior of the simulator changes 
can be made in 5by5.xml, however the simulator must be restarted each time. In order to move 
objects around on the field click on <font color="blue">RobocupDisplay.exe</font>. This brings 
up a GLUT interface to the simulator, and allows robots to be moved around as described in the 
debugging tools section. Now that the simulator is running, start the AI by running 
<font color="blue">localAI.bat</font> in the runtime folder since you'll be connecting to 
a vision system on the local machine.
<p>
If you wish to connect to the simulator through the debugger in Visual studio, you must 
set the working directory and program arguments first. Click on Project on the title menu. 
Click Settings. Click on Debug tab. Enter 127.0.0.1 for the program arguments, since you are 
connecting to a simulator running locally. For the working directory enter ..\runtime_folder 
since by default VC++ uses the MSDEV folder where the project dsw lives. When you hit F5 to 
start the system in the debugger it should be able to connect to a local simulator.
