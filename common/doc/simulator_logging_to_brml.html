    <h2><b>Logging to BRML</b></h2>

<p align="left"><font color="#000000" size="3">If the logging is turned ON, the
simulation will be logged in a file. The file will be in brml format which can
be loaded later using the BRML player and played again.</font>
<p>
<font color="#000000" size="3">Go to criss\crissMain and open up
CrissMain.dsw in Microsoft Visual C++. Then open the file PhysicsWorld.cpp. If
you look around lines 180-200, you will see logging variable set to false. Just
set it to true and recompile the program. Next time you run the simulator, you
will see a logged file created for the simulation. The log file will be named
log1.brml and will be created in the criss\runtime folder. You can change the
name of the log-file from PhysicsWorld.cpp around lines 230-250 where the log is
initialized. </font></p>
